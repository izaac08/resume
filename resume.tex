    Outside of my professional pursuits, I am actively engaged in various university intramural sports, including soccer, basketball, and slo-pitch. I also enjoy a wide range of physical activities such as tennis, bouldering, racing, and backpacking. When time permits, I unwind by reading, as well as playing board and video games, which allow me to foster creativity and strategic thinking.
